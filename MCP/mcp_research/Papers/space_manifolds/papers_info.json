    "summary": "In 1972, K. Kenmotsu studied a class of almost contact Riemannian manifolds.\nLater, such a manifold was called a Kenmotsu manifold. This paper, we studied\nKenmotsu manifolds with $(2n+s)$-dimensional $s-$contact metric manifold and\nthis manifold, we have called generalized Kenmotsu manifolds. Necessary and\nsufficient condition is given for an almost $s-$contact metric manifold to be a\ngeneralized Kenmotsu manifold.We show that a generalized Kenmotsu manifold is a\nlocally warped product space. In addition, we study some curvature properties\nof generalized Kenmotsu manifolds. Moreover, we show that the $\\varphi $%\n-sectional curvature of any semi-symmetric and projective semi-symmetric $%\n(2n+s)$-dimensional generalized Kenmotsu manifold is $-s$.",

    "summary": "A selfsimiar manifold is a Riemannian manifold $\\left(M,g\\right)$ endowed\nwith a homothetic vector field $\\xi$. We characterize global selfsimilar\nmanifolds and describe the structure of local selfsimilar manifolds. We prove\nthat any selfsimilar manifold with a potential homothetic vector field is a\nconical Riemannian manifold or a Eucledean space. A radiant Hessian manifold is\nselfsimilar Hessian manifold $\\left(M,\\nabla,g,\\xi\\right)$ such that\n$\\nabla\\xi=\\lambda \\text{Id}$. We prove that any selfsimilar Hessian manifold\nwith a potential homothetic vector field is locally isomorphic to a product\nradiant Hessian manifolds and describe the local structure of radiant\nselfsimialar Hessian manifolds.",
