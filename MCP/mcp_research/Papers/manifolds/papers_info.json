Necessary and\nsufficient condition is given for an almost $s-$contact metric manifold to be a\ngeneralized Kenmotsu manifold.We show that a generalized Kenmotsu manifold is a\nlocally warped product space. In addition, we study some curvature properties\nof generalized Kenmotsu manifolds.

    "summary": "A BIonic diode is constructed of two polygonal manifolds connected by a\nChern-Simons manifold. The shape and the angle between atoms of molecules on\nthe boundary of two polygonal manifolds are completely different. For this\nreason, electrons on the Chern-Simons manifold are repelled by molecules at the\nboundary of one manifold and absorbed by molecules on the boundary of another\nmanifold. The attractive and repulsive forces between electrons are carried by\nmasive photons. For example, when two non-similar trigonal manifolds join to\neach other, one non-symmetrical hexagonal manifold is emerged and the exchanged\nphotons form Chern-Simons fields which live on a Chern-Simons manifold in a\nBIon. While, for a hexagonal manifold, with similar trigonal manifolds, the\nphotons exchanged between two trigonal manifolds cancel the effect of each\nother and BIonic energy becomes zero. Also, exchanging photons between\nheptagonal and pentagonal manifolds lead to the motion of electrons on the\nChern-Simons manifold and formation of BIonic diode. The mass of photons depend\non the shape of molecules on the boundary of manifolds and the length of BIon\nin a gap between two manifolds.",
